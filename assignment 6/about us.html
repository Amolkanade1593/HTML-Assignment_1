    <p>User experience design is the process of defining the experience a user would go through when interacting with a 
        digital product or website. Design decisions in UX design are often driven by research, 
        data analysis, and test results rather than aesthetic preferences and opinions.
        UI design and UX design are two of the most often confused and conflated terms in 
        web and app design. And understandably so. They’re usually placed together in a single term, UI/UX design, 
        and viewed from the surface they seem to be describing the same thing. It’s often hard to find solid descriptions of the two that don’t 
        descend too far into jargon. But fear not!</p>
